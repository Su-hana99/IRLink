# IRLink

A GPS-based IRL social matching app that helps shy or introverted people connect at events or public spaces. Users are matched based on shared interests, and given subtle clues (like location or outfit hints) to identify each other and start conversations.

## Features:
- Interest-based profile creation
- AI-generated conversation prompts
- GPS clue-based meetups (privacy-friendly)
- Social anxiety-friendly design
